# Forza Horizon 2 .swatchbin Extractor


# About it:


This tool can be used for converting Forza Horizon 2 Car Textures (.SWATCHBIN) into .DDS (DirectDraw Surface) files. This tool is being developed in C# with Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and with base on the xg_x(Xbox Graphics) dll. Feel free to contribute if you want to work on it :)

# How to use it (Doesn't work for now!)


Just drag the .SWATCHBIN file into the .exe app and it will convert it :)
